          Future technology must be better and obsolete technology must be improved to provide the technological innovation which is easy to use and fast. Similar to the medical diagnosis which requires doctor to identify the illness of people, identifying the problems in IT system requires the analyst who has knowledge and skills.

Bachelor of Science Program in Information Technology (BSIT) focuses on the preparation of IT system analyst and software engineer for IT market.

We emphasize on the development of studentsâ€™ knowledge and skills to discover and analyze the weak points of IT systems and improve them with the technological innovations which helps the business to be the leader in the competitive world. Real-world experiences and practical learning are used in teaching and learning to help students understand, learn, analyze, create, interact, and share experiences with each other. Real international environment helps students to be able to speak proper English, work as a team, and be the international leader.
